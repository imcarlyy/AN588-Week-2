## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m

#Matrices are typically filled column-wise, with the argument, byrow, set to FALSE by default, but this can be changed by specifying this argument as TRUE. For example, this is how it's set by default. 

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
m

#This is how it could be if you want to fill it row-wise: 

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m

#Now, to also create matrices in R by binding vectors of the same length together either row-wise (with the function rbind()) or column-wise (with the function cbind()). Like this: 
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- cbind(v1, v2)
m1

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2)

#############################################################
#
#NOTE: in this example, rownames are not defined, since cbind() was used to create the matrix
#
rownames(m2)
#
#Okay, now: The structure (str()) command can be applied to any data structure to provide details about that object. This is an incredibly useful function that you will find yourself using over and over again. For example: 

str(m2)

#*********************** You got this as result down in your console: ************************************

#num [1:4, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
#- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
# ..$ : NULL
#  ..$ : chr [1:2] "v1" "v2"

#***********You need to undestand that:******************
#
#1) num: This means m2 is a numeric object (likely a matrix or array).
#
#2) [1:4, 1:2]: The dimensions of m2. It's a 4x2 matrix (4 rows, 2 columns).
#
#3) 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9: These are the values stored in the matrix, read in column-major order (the first column has 1, 2, 3, 4, the second column has 6, 7, 8, 9).
#
#4) attr(*, "dimnames"): This tells us about the dimension names (like row and column names).
#The first part ..$ : NULL means there are no names for the #rows.
#The second part ..$ : chr [1:2] "v1" "v2" tells us that the column names are "v1" and "v2".
#
#
#Overall, In this case, it's a 4x2 matrix with numeric values and column names "v1" and "v2".
#
#*****************************************CLOSING THIS EXAMPLE ****************************
#
a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3))
a

v <- 1:100
v
#You can select the first 15 elements as follows:
v[1:15]

#You can also give a vector of index values to use to subset:
v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)]

v <- 101:200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)]
#
#Remember that the 1, 16, 31 and 46 from your out mean:
#The first value, 101, is at position 1 in the output vector.
#The 16th value, 131, is at position 16 in the output vector.
#The 31st value, 161, is at position 31 in the output vector.
#The 46th value, 191, is at position 46 in the output vector.

#2) SECOND STEP: if I wanted to extract an element, for instance here, the element in row 4, column 5, AND assign it to a new variable, x, I would do this: 
x <- m[4, 5] #this is the command that I would use to do what I just mentioned before. 
x #this is what I would write to see the result of my command
#

#2.1 You can also see this process like this:

#This is how you complete challenge 2, part 1

# only print select columns
df[, c(1, 3, 4, 11, 12)]
#
#So you kept having this issue where the fifth column was off (bottom). Therefore, in the following code, you just added the df_select part; a little different than the code Chris gave you in the Module ***df[, c(1, 3, 4, 11, 12)]***

library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/Carly Rojas/OneDrive - Universidad San Francisco de Quito/Documentos/A_MS IN BIOLOGY/SCHMITT_588 Project Design and Statistics/random-people.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df_selected
#
#AND NOW, if we want details about our project "df", we simply can put use the following function + df inside of it. You know, just to let it know that we want the details of the df project. 
str(df)
#
#Now, you can ALSO select and subset data frames using bracket notation. You can also select named columns from a data frame the $ operator.For example...
df[, 3]
#OR, If you need a compact summary of the structure of the third column, you can also use this function/code: 
str(df[, 3])
str(df[, 3])
#AND YOU MIGHT WONDER, WTF IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FUNCTION? THEY SORT OF GIVE YOU THE SAME RESUL. WELL, NOOOOOOO. 
# The second command shows you more details of the third column, such as: 
###    chr: The data type, meaning it's a character vector.
#      [1:20]: The index range of elements in the vector (from 1 to 20 in this case).
#      Then it shows the first few elements in the vector (the first names).
#Overall, str(df[, 3]) The difference is that str() provides additional metadata about the structure of the object, which is especially useful when you're dealing with more complex data structures (e.g., lists, data frames, etc.).
#
#
#Now, let's say you want to extract and display the values from the "name.last" column of the df data frame. Well, you would use the following code, which basically tells R "give me the column named 'name.last' from the data frame 'df'".
df$name.last
#
#
#The following code, on the other hand, Gives a compact summary of the structure of the "name.last" column, including its type (chr for character), its length ([1:20]), and a preview of the first few values in the column.
str(df$name.last)
#
#
#Now, if you want to ONLY select A COLUMN, i.e., the third column of the data frame df (or to select the 3rd element, if you want to think of it in terms of position), you use the following code: 
df[3]
#
#
#Okay, now again being more precise, IF YOU WANT TO ASK R to tell you about the structure of the third column of df, which has been extracted as a data frame, you use next function: str() + the previous function: LOOK!
str(df[3])
#
#
#Now, the following code will select the column named name.last from the data frame and return it as a data frame, rather than a vector. If you need a visual example of the difference in the results of this one, I'll leave a picture of it in your Notion folder. 
df["name.last"]
#
#Now if we wanna be more precise with the info...
str(df["name.last"])
#
#
#OKAY, NOW, You can add rows (additional cases) or columns (additional variables) to a data frame using rbind() and cbind(). In other words, the cbind() function is used to add columns to a data frame. It stands for "column bind", and it allows us to bind new columns to an existing data frame.
df <- cbind(df, id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
    17, 18, 19, 20))
df <- cbind(df, school = c("BU", "BU", "Harvard", "Harvard", "BU", "Boston College",
    "MIT", "BU", "BU", "UMASS Boston", "Harvard", "BU", "Boston College", "BU",
    "Harvard", "MIT", "Harvard", "BU", "UMASS Boston", "Harvard"))
df
#
#Alternatively, you can extend a data frame by adding a new variable directly using the $ operator, like this:
df$school <- c("BU", "BU", "Harvard", "Harvard", "BU", "Boston College", "MIT",
    "BU", "BU", "UMASS Boston", "Harvard", "BU", "Boston College", "BU", "Harvard",
    "MIT", "Harvard", "BU", "UMASS Boston", "Harvard")
